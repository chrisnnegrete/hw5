Includes old "Bubbles!" Program with sound, and practice with loops.

Midterm Project Ideas:

1) Lightspeed Simulator: Click the screen to travel at lightspeed and end up in a random environment while the Star Wars lightspeed sound effects play.
2) Instant Buttons: A soundboard that creates randomized artwork of some kind in another canvas.
3) Fallout Radio: A jukebox with a 1950's song library that changes when you hit a button and animates the record going onto the platter.
